# Thin Film Optimisation

## Abstract
This report presents a prototype system that models the flow of thin layers of fluids (thin-films or droplets) over solid surfaces. It focuses on the naturally occurring phenomena of thin-film motion under the influence of wettability and capillarity. The motivation comes from existing discussions on developing the equations of thin-films, such as U. Thiele [Note on thin-film equations for solutions and suspensions].

By producing a rigorous model, the intention is to develop an automatic optimisation procedure which determines the initial droplet locations in order to guarantee the termination of our thin-films evolution at a specified target shape. The study also explores the resulting changes when the system is under the influences of viscosity variations, with regards to the introductions of dissolved solute particle (often referred to as colloids), and temperature variations. In particular, it considers phase-changes such as evaporation. This is achieved by applying techniques borrowed from fluid mechanics, particle dynamics, and other relevant areas of scientific study.
